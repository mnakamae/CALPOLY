# Function Generator

## Description
This function generator upon startup outputs a square wave at 100 Hz with a 50% duty cycle. Using the keypad buttons 6 - 9, the user can respectively output a triangle, square, sinusoidal, or sawtooth wave. The user is also able to set the output frequency to 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, or 500Hz with the 1 - 5 buttons on the keypad. Additionally, the duty cycle for a square wave can be adjusted from 10% to 90% in intervals of 10 using the * and # buttons to, respectively, decrease and increase the duty cycle. On the other hand, pressing 0 resets the duty cycle to 50%.
