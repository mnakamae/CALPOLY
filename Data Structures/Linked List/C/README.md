# Linked List

## Description
This small project implemented a simple linked list structure in C. I implemented this while learning C to gain a better understanding of handling dynamic memory in C since I had previously only worked with Java and Python.


## Instructions
There are no additional libraries needed to run this program. To compile and run enter the following into a terminal:

make

./LinkedList
