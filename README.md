# Portfolio

My name is Mark Nakamae, and I am currently a 4th year studying Computer Engineering. This repository contains all school-related projects completed during my time at Cal Poly SLO. I've organized projects into different classes, with instructions to compile and run each, as well as a brief overhead description of the project itself.
