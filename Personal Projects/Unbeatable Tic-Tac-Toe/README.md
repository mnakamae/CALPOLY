# Word Frequency Counter

## Description
This project looked to create an unbeatable opponent in the simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I accomplished this by implementing the minimax algorithm, in which moves are recursively scored based on the likelihood of a win for the computer. In other words, moves that led to a computer victory scored higher and moves that led to a human player win scored negatively. The algorithm recursively follows the possible moves sequences from both players, then returns the most optimal one. Since this project focused more on the implementation on minimax, I decided to make the game itself a very simple terminal text based implementation.

## Instructions
There are no additional libraries needed for this project. To run this program, type the following command into a terminal:

python3 minimax.py
