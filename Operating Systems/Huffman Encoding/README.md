# Huffman Encoding

## Description
This project implemented encoding and decoding for huffman encoding, a process used for lossless data compression using a linked list and binary search tree to count/organize the frequencies of characters in the input file.


## Instructions for Encoding
There are no additional libraries needed for this project. To compile and run the huffman encoding, type the following commands into a terminal:

make

./hencode [infile] [outfile]


## Instructions for Decoding
To compile and run the huffman decoding, type the following commands into a terminal:

make

./hdecode [infile] [outfile]
