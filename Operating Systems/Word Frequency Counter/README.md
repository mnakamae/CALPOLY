# Word Frequency Counter

## Description
This project involved reading in a specified input file, and printing out the n most common words and their frequencies. This was a fairly straightforward project, but a good introductory project to coding in C. I read the input document one word at a time, hashed the string, and stored it in a hash table to allow fast and easy look up. Again, this was my first project coding in C and I learned so much from doing this. Most importantly, I learned the difference between fixed and dynamic memory allocation, as well as the proper usage of malloc and free. I learned what pointers were and the difference between pass by value and pass by reference. And lastly, I learned how to use comparators in C which allowed for fast sorting of the input data.


## Instructions
There are no additional libraries needed for this project. The -n flag specifies how many of the most frequent words to print. To compile and run the huffman encoding, type the following commands into a terminal:

make

./fw -n [num words] [infiles]
