# Caesar Cipher

## DESCRIPTION
This project involved deciphering ciphertexts encrypted using the caesar cipher algorithm. This is a simple substitution encryption algorithm that replaces letters based on the specified shift in alphabet dictated by a key letter. This algorithm can be solved through brute force and simple frequency analysis to find the decrypted plaintext. The sample encrypted files can be found in the encrypted directory.


## INSTRUCTIONS
There are no additional libraries needed to run this program. To run enter the following into a terminal:

python3 caesar.py [file to be decrypted]
